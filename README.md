# confessions-of-a-coding-monkey

This repository will eventually contain my own solutions to all problems in the second edition of the textbook *Confessions of a Coding Monkey* by Michael A. Wirth. 

This textbook was used in my *CIS 1500 - Introduction to Programming* course at the University of Guelph in Fall 2013. The language used in the textbook is C.

Some of my solutions contain features that go beyond the essential program requirements. This was done to apply knowledge from prior problems.

All solutions are numbered according to the textbook and contain comments particular to my own learning. They were written using the C programming language in the Code::Blocks 20.03 IDE and compiled using MinGW-w64 4.3.5 for Windows.
